This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About Me
Hello! I'm a Tepper MBA Student at CMU, who is from the bay area!

# What I hope to learn
In my previous work, I dealt with data analysis on a daily basis. My hope is to be able to translate that data to compelling visualizations and tell a story that is easy to understand.

# Portfolio
This will be the home of all my interesting data visualization work!
