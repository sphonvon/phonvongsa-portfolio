# Final Project: Part I

# An Outline
Summary: The pathway to reclaiming mental health, by decreasing stigma and developing more resources, education, and support, can be through innovating and iterating in social media and technology. 

User Stories:

As a reader, I want to show a combination of art, real examples/stories, and critical data points on mental health so that I can demonstrate how relatable and common mental health issues are.

As a reader, I want more spaces for discussion on mental health so that others can develop a sense of community, understanding, and empathy.  

As a reader, I want to demonstrate the global and economic repercussions of mental illness so that I can show the importance of decreasing stigma.

# Data
[Talkspace Mental Health Statistics](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/mental-health-statistics/)
These mental health statistics will mainly be displayed through infographics using the tool, Inforgram. This data will be utilized to demonstrate how common mental illness is on an individual and global level. The goal is to nomalize mental illness to reduce stigma. Additionaly, this data will be utilized to demonstrate why this topic is important. Mental illness affects lifespan, physical health, suicide, and earnings loss, which demonstrates mental illness' real-world and economic impact. Furthermore, this data will also show the top mental illnesses to highlight what is most common in the U.S. Lastly, the data can also be leveraged to add more context behind the cultural and racial stigma of mental illness.

[Happy Planet Index Score] (https://github.com/sphonvon/repo/files/4179109/hpi-data-2016.xlsx)
The Happy Planet Index Score data will be displayed through a geographic interactive map using Tableau. This data will show Happy Planet Index scores around the world to provide context of the state of happiness on a global level. Since happiness and mental illness are negatively correlated, the data will put into perspective the persavsiveness of mental illness.

# Method and Medium
For part two of my final project, I will continue to use Balsamiq to develop wireframes to visualize my story arc even further. I plan on getting user feedback from my classmates and peers on whether or not the structure of my story is understandable and follows a sequence that makes sense. I would also like to get feedback on whether my ideas on how I am representing the data can be improved. My goal is to use diverse tools and chart types to demonstrate what I have learned in the class. With that said, I still want to maintain a level of simplicity in design and color for each visualization. Moreover, I want to receive feedback on whether or not the data I chose to support my story arc is actually relevant and purposeful. Beyond this, I want to get feedback on my topic -- specifically if the mental health resources and recommendation list is comprehensive and can be applied to a diverse range of groups. 

For part three, I plan on using Shorthand to build and share my story. I plan on reviewing previous final project examples on Shorthand to get a better understanding of the length and depth of my story. I will also dedicate time on theme and design of my project as well as incorporating further tools and concepts that I have learned in class to round out my story.

For part four, I plan on creating an outline of the key points I want to make during my presentation. I will practice running through my presentation a few times to make sure that I am within the time limit. I will also gather feedback on my presentation from my classmates and peers to check if my story and presentation is clear, understandable, and memorable. I want the audience to recognize the call to action and hopefully inspire change.

# Creation of a user research protocol and completion of at least three interviews

User Research Protocol

Target Audience:
Since my final project is about mental health awareness, I am looking for someone who has not experienced a mental health crisis and may not know much about the topic. In addition, I would also like to interview someone who has experienced a mental health crisis and ask whether or not these visuals, dataset, and story is consistent or relevant to their experience. Finally, I would like to find someone who has downloaded a mental health app since the latter half of my story revolves around technological innovation and mental health app usage.

Approach:
In identifying each of these three audience members, I reached out to my current network (e.g. friends, classmates, and family). I was mostly worried if I could find a person who has downloaded a mental health app since it is not a common app download. However, reaching out to classmates in the Tepper Quad and describing the variety of mental health app categories allowed for me to find an audience member.

Interview Script:
1. Have you ever experienced a mental health crisis?
2. Heave you ever downloaded a mental health app?
3. How would you rate your knowledge of mental health? (Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 as not very knowledgeable and 5 as extremely knowledgeable)
4. Discuss the premise of my final project and show wireframes as I tell my story
5. (After finished sharing wireframes and telling story) Did the wireframes follow a natural and thooughtful sequence of events? If not, what can be improved?
6. Were there any unclear visuals? If so, what can be improved?
7. What do you think is the main goal of the story?
8. What do you think were the call to actions? Did the call to action resonate with you? If not, what can be improved?
9. Were there any holes in the story?
10. Was there any point in the story or visuals where you would have enjoyed a deeper dive?

Findings:
From my interviews, I learned that there was interest in my topic and that it was surprisingly more relatable than I had thought. This was a positive because it meant that I had a more interested, engaged, and sometimes knowledgeable audience. I learned that the story was actually long to tell and from this, I know that when I do my final presentation in front of the class, I will focus on the parts of my story that are most interesting. In terms on feedback on my story arc, I learned that it may be more interesting to focus on the technology part of my presentation since it is the solution I am proposing for mental health awareness and bridging the gap between resources. In one of my interviews, it was suggested to further deep dive into the efficacy of mental health apps. For the audience member that actually had a mental health app, this was a particular interest since she found it difficult to constantly use the app. The feedback that I also received was that I presented a lot of data and although the charts were interesting, I could increase interest and relatability by making the data more personal. There was not an immediate suggestion to remedy this but I think I can try to incorporate personas to make the data more relatable. It seems like one of the more interesting graphs was on the Tableau Geo Map chart. Audience members were curious about which countries I would contrast the U.S. with and actually wanted an explanation of how the happiness index was determined.

Changes Implemented to Sketches, Storyboard, and Wireframes:
Based on my conversations, to bring more clarity to the story arc and point I was trying to make, I tried to make the titles for each wireframe signifiy the main point I was trying to make (e.g. "Mental Illness is More Common Than You Think"). There were some wireframes where I could not outline the main takeaway because it would require more further data analysis. For instance, the Happiness Index wireframe does not have a main takeaway because I need to see how the U.S. compares to the rest of the world and if there are other trends that should be highlighted (e.g. is happiness declining over time?). I added bubble blurbs with questions to the audience to try to make the data more relatable and also to make the audience think about how this information I'm displaying is displaying a new perpecitive. In this way, I am trying to make the information and presentation more interactive by challenging my audience to digest and think about the consequences of the data. I also received feedback that my infographic placeholders had a lot of text. I am aware of this but there was no infographic template in Balsamiq. I will remember to keep this in mind and make sure that there is less text and more images to demonstrate the key points I am making. Lastly, explaining the different kind of mental health apps was difficult without having examples. I remember in class that the Professor stated that we may not be able to endorse apps -- I will definitely ask the Professor about this because showing examples of apps will help the audience understand and grasp the technology better.
